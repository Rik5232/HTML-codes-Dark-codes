You can customize the codes this means you have rights to edit the code and use it for ur usage.
But you need to always include credits/invite code those both can be https://discord.gg/devs or https://invite.arkmobilebot.ga/
In all the code those credits are already. just dont delete them and its fine.
if there are codes with no credits its also fine.
